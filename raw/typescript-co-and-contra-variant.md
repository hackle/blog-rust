Why is `{ 'f1': string, 'f2': number } & { 'f2': number, 'f3': string }` not `{ 'f2': number }`?

And ready for some fireworks with the wild mix of union, intersection and variance?

(It must be the [street-light effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) that I keep going back to co-variants and contra-variants across a few languages. Most recently it's for the magic of [conversion from union to tuple type](/typescript-union-to-tuple-array).)

# Union and Intersection: count values, not fields

Give two types `A` and `B`, when put in a union `A | B`, a looser type is created. If we count its values, the union type have values from `A` + values from `B`, so union types are also called sum types. This feature itself is straightforward - albeit sorely missing from many main stream languages.

When an intersection is created from `A & B`, a stricter / more specific type is created. It only has values that are both `A` and `B`. This can be confusing to many, especially when it comes to object types. 

Quite reminiscent of algebra, we can start by looking at the intersection of unions.

```TypeScript
type T1 = 'a' | 'b';
type T2 = 'b' | 'c';

// type T3 = "b"
type T3 = T1 & T2;
```

Very intuitive and true to the name "intersection". But how about this?

```TypeScript
type T4 = { 'f1': string, 'f2': number };
type T5 = { 'f2': number, 'f3': string };

type T6 = T4 & T5;
```

Surely `T6` should be `{ 'f2': number }`?! This was exactly what I first thought. However `T6` is actually `{ 'f1': string, 'f2': number, 'f3': string }`. Why is that?

The reason is the `&` operator does not really inspect the fields of the object types, instead, the intersection applies to the values of `T4` and `T5`. What does that mean?

Think of `T4` and `T5` not as objects, because they are not - they are types! If it makes any sense, turn them into interfaces. 

```TypeScript
interface I4 { 'f1': string, 'f2': number };
interface I5 { 'f2': number, 'f3': string };

interface I6 extends I4, I5 {}
```

A trained Object-oriented mind (that's you, yes) should grok this right away. Any value of interface `I6` must have all 3 fields to satisfy both `I4` and `I5` - it's a stricter type than each.

The name "intersection" makes sense if we count the values of each type: values of `I6` is the intersection of values of `I4` and `I5`. 

# Union and intersection of one

The philosophical and curious will find there is an interesting case to the union and intersection duality. When standing alone, a type is both a single-case union and a single-case intersection on its own. This may sound like a smart-ass revelation, but it can offer some interesting perspectives.

```TypeScript
type T7 = { 'f1': string };
type T8 = { 'f2': number };

type T9 = T7 | T8;
const v9_1: T9 = { 'f1': 'a' };
const v9_2: T9 = { 'f2': 1 };

type T10 = T7 & T8;
const v10: T10 = { 'f1': 'a', 'f2': 1 };
```

By using `|` or `&` as combinator, we can build up more complex types. For example, this naive yet fun `Parse` type.

```TypeScript
type Parse<T extends string> = 
    T extends `${infer T1} or ${infer T2}`
    ? Parse<T1> | Parse<T2>
    : T extends `${infer T1} and ${infer T2}`
        ? Parse<T1> & Parse<T2>
        : { [k in T]: true };

const p1: Parse<'a and b and c'> = { 'a': true, 'b': true, 'c': true };
const p2_a: Parse<'a or b'> = { 'a': true };
const p2_b: Parse<'a or b'> = { 'b': true };
```

# Intersection of keys of union

Intersection and union can appear quite closely in unexpected places. An easy example is when we try to access the properties of a union type - the available keys are the intersection of the keys of all the cases of the union type. 

```TypeScript
// type T4 = { 'f1': string, 'f2': number };
// type T5 = { 'f2': number, 'f3': string };

type T11 = T4 | T5;

// const v11: "f2"
declare const v11: keyof T11;

// const v12: "f2", same!
declare const v12: keyof T4 & keyof T5;
```

This makes sense: only the common keys can be safe for operations such as `T11['f2']`; but not `T11['f1']` as it's unsafe for `T5`.

# Variance recap

We already know that TypeScript respects variance (previously [discussed in C#](contravariant)). Never missing the opportunity to look at it again.

With covariance, typically when `T` is the return type of a function.

```TypeScript
type Covariant<T> = () => T;

let co1: Covariant<'a' | 'b'>;

declare const co2: Covariant<'a'>;
co1 = co2; // this is ok

declare const co3: Covariant<'a' | 'b' | 'c'>;
/*
Type 'Covariant<"a" | "b" | "c">' is not assignable to type 'Covariant<"a" | "b">'.
  Type '"a" | "b" | "c"' is not assignable to type '"a" | "b"'.
    Type '"c"' is not assignable to type '"a" | "b"'.ts(2322)
*/
co1 = co3;
```

However, when `T` is a parameter type, then the assignability is reversed - quite the mind-bender!

```TypeScript
type ContraVariant<T> = (arg: T) => void;

let contr1: ContraVariant<'a' | 'b'>;

declare const contr2: ContraVariant<'a' | 'b' | 'c'>;
contr1 = contr2;    // this is ok!

declare const contr3: ContraVariant<'a'>;
/*
Type 'ContraVariant<"a">' is not assignable to type 'ContraVariant<"a" | "b">'.
  Type '"a" | "b"' is not assignable to type '"a"'.
    Type '"b"' is not assignable to type '"a"'.ts(2322)
*/
contr1 = contr3;
```

We can also [give them signs](contravariant): co-variance is positive and contra-variance negative. Take some time, let that sink in.

# Variance, union and intersection, the fantastic mix

Intersection or union alone is not fun enough; things become **really** interesting when variance is involved.

Before we jump in, we need a couple of utility types from [a previous post](typescript-union-to-tuple-array), `Contra<T>` that takes `T` to a contra-variant position, namely, as a parameter. Note `T` can be any type, even a `Contra<T>` itself. And `Co<T>` for the opposite. 

```TypeScript
type Co<T> = () => T;
type Contra<T> = (arg: T) => void;
```

Then we have `InferContra` and `InferCo` that recovers `T`, with an important note: if `Fn` is a union type, it will be matched only once, as `[Fn]` stops [union distribution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#distributive-conditional-types). So it's not the complete reverse engineering of `Co` or `Contra`. That is possible without the `[Fn]` trick.

```TypeScript
type InferCo<Fn> = 
    [Fn] extends [Co<infer T>] ? T : never;

type InferContra<Fn> = 
    [Fn] extends [Contra<infer T>] ? T : never;
```

Now let's see what happens.

```TypeScript
/*
const infer_co1: {
    f1: 'f1';
} | {
    f2: 'f2';
} 
*/
declare const infer_co1: InferCo<
    Co<{ f1: 'f1' }> |
    Co<{ f2: 'f2' }>
>;

/*
const contra1: {
    f1: 'f1';
} & {
    f2: 'f2';
}
*/
declare const contra1: InferContra<
    Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }> |
    Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>
>;

// remember ^ is equivalent to
declare const infer_contra2: [
    ((arg: { f1: 'f1' }) => void) |
    ((arg: { f2: 'f2' }) => void)
] extends [ ((arg: infer I) => void) ] 
    ? I 
    : never;
```

Do you see what's happening? `InferCo` is plain predictable, but `InferContra` from a union of two contra-variant types returns an intersection type! (Ok that's quite a mouthful.) Contra-variance strikes again in stunning fashion. 

## Inferred twice?

Can we make sense of it? Well... kind of. We can "desugar" `InferContra` further for this specific case,

```TypeScript
type InferUnionContra<Fn> =
    [Fn] extends [((arg: infer T) => void) | ((arg: infer T) => void)]
    ? T
    : never;
    
/*
const infer_union_contra: {
    f1: 'f1';
} & {
    f2: 'f2';
}
*/
declare const infer_union_contra: InferUnionContra<
    Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }> |
    Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>
>;
```

Notice how `infer T` can be used **twice** in the same `extends` clause? That forces TypeScript to return a single type that accounts for both of its appearances - depending on its positioning (therefore variance).

But how do we know for sure that `InferContra` is giving us the correct result?

## Equational reasoning, and variance again

Let's call on a pretty reputable judge of character, **Equational Reasoning** (multiple rounds of thunder and lightning)! This is done by expanding the conditional type by putting in the actual input and output.

```TypeScript
/* 
    remember: 
    type Contra<T> = (arg: T) => void;
    type InferContra<Fn> = [Fn] extends [Contra<infer T>] ? T : never;
*/

// the expanded form of: Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }> | Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>
type UnionInput = ((arg: { f1: 'f1' }) => void) | ((arg: { f2: 'f2' }) => void);

type IntersectionSatisfiesEquation = 
    [UnionInput] extends [((arg: { f1: 'f1' } & { f2: 'f2' }) => void)] ? true : false;
```

Let's also recap: `T extend U` holds if `T` is a subtype of `U`, such as `'a' extends string`. In another word, A value of `T` can be assigned to a variable of `U`. 

By this reasoning `InferContra` is proof that the union `((arg: { f1: 'f1' }) => void) | ((arg: { f2: 'f2' }) => void)` is a subtype of `((arg: { f1: 'f1' } & { f2: 'f2' }) => void)`. This can be proven as below.

```TypeScript
declare let contra_union: ((arg: { f1: 'f1' }) => void) | ((arg: { f2: 'f2' }) => void);
declare let contra_intersection: ((arg: { f1: 'f1' } & { f2: 'f2' }) => void);

// a subtype can be assigned to a supertype
contra_intersection = contra_union;
```

Which, by distribution, means each case of the union type `((arg: { f1: 'f1' }) => void) | ((arg: { f2: 'f2' }) => void)` can be assigned to the intersection `((arg: { f1: 'f1' } & { f2: 'f2' }) => void)`. By variance manipulation, this further means `{ f1: 'f1' } & { f2: 'f2' }` is a subtype (mind the shift of direction) of either `{ f1: 'f1' }` or `{ f2: 'f2' }`, which is true, as we have discussed in the beginning. Check!

## Contra of contra of contra-variant

We are not done yet. Knowing how contra-variance can be thought of as the minus sign, and double minus equals plus (genius!), we can test out the thoroughness of this behaviour (or feature). It's showtime.

```TypeScript
type InferContra2<T> = 
    [T] extends [Contra<Contra<infer I>>] ? I : never;

type InferContra3<T> = 
    [T] extends [Contra<Contra<Contra<infer I>>>] ? I : never;

type InferContra4<T> = 
    [T] extends [Contra<Contra<Contra<Contra<infer I>>>>] ? I : never;
    
/*
const contra2: {
    f1: 'f1';
} | {
    f2: 'f2';
}
*/
declare const contra2: InferContra2<
    Contra<Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }>> |
    Contra<Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>>
>;

/*
const contra3: {
    f1: 'f1';
} & {
    f2: 'f2';
}
*/
declare const contra3: InferContra3<
    Contra<Contra<Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }>>> |
    Contra<Contra<Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>>>
>;

/*
const contra4: {
    f1: 'f1';
} | {
    f2: 'f2';
}
*/
declare const contra4: InferContra4<
    Contra<Contra<Contra<Contra<{ f1: 'f1' }>>>> |
    Contra<Contra<Contra<Contra<{ f2: 'f2' }>>>>
>;
```

I'll be damned... It is CHECK, CHECK and CHECK. The result types alternate between union and intersection. TypeScript really thought this through. I am impressed.
