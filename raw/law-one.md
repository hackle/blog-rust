"Is 5 equal to 5?"

The right answer to this question is, "Who is asking?"

# which "team" is it?

I am not a fan of using analogies but if there is one occasion then this is it :)

I am an Arsenal supporter (spare your sympathy). In football, I guess much like other sports, when a team has very unpredictable form, sometimes the TV reporters will say before a game in a dramatic way, "let's see which Arsenal team show up today!" 

Now if you think about it, this is a strange statement to make. First of all, there is only one Arsenal, so the team will be called Arsenal whichever way. One can argue team is made up of players, but my guess is the reporters are exactly not referring to selection of players either - the starting lineup would be more of less stable. What they are saying, in my opinion, is for the same team and lineup, they might play so differently, it appears they are a completely different "team".

As a fan we would expect the "best team" will show up, which is to say they will play well. But it is likely a poor team show up - which the fans must admit happens too often in recent seasons.

You would have guess where I am going with this analogy and how my frustration as a football fan reflects similar frustrations in programming.

# names, values and consistency

What's comparable in football and programming is that we all long for consistency. In football, I would like the team to always have the form (as impossible as that maybe). In programming, it's much simpler: that something remains what it is over time, so when briefly look away and then look at, it does not magically disappear and change into something else.

This is the point you will all laugh at me - dude, what are you talking about?! Do you even know how programming works?! That indeed will be a tough question, because I am not sure if I do. But I may say I know how programming might NOT work, and this is what we are talking about.



# how did we get here?

I would like to borrow [this meme](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d7/dependency.png) that typically refers to LibCurl, an HTTP library that underlies an amazing amount of code that supports the modern software world that we know.

It would work equally well if we swap out LibCurl for "5 equals 5", which we haven't figured out completely.

# what's a law?

Software is mostly about 

Laughters, or confusion

Think about it - nothing really makes much sense if we can't compare A to B, or more trivially, A to A itself.

"Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain"
Completely living up to the fantastic title, [this talk by Runar Bjarnason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqmsQeSzMdw) is a must watch.

How many 5s are there? 
If one, it's identity, otherwise not?
Reference equality, not equal to itself?

Are we in the golden age or programming, or stone age?

Reference and value: how many 5s are there?

Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive

Structural & Reference, Type Equality

Structural typing in TypeScript

Workarounds: WithXXX, Spread, Lens

Ideals: language support

Unified types: equality by default

AngularJS and React - change detection

Don't throw away good qualities like equality

CAP is the bane of existence for CAP

Microservices, syncing. Do you want them to be equal or not?
